                      <p>The message tends to get diluted when operations are handled manually. And law enforcement enables the justice system to function in an appropriate manner. The Ahmedabad city police embraced IT infrastructure to upgrade their way of operations communication for Speedy complaints tracking , FIRs along with organized records for better scrutiny. ABMS understands the essence of time in the case of law enforcement. So, management practices were incorporated beyond command and control. With digitized internal communication, better developments in policing took shape giving birth to a uniform framework.</p>

                     <p>Policing is no easy task, it is every bit challenging, unpredictable, and defining discretion. So, when we talk about bringing harmony to policing operations, it does not limit to management and planning. It also envelopes keeping every team member in the loop and creates a conducive environment for smoother communication. ABMS conducted thorough primary research with citizen satisfaction surveys which in return enabled to understand the loopholes in the management. Furthermore, core trainings was provided to officers of every level in the complete jurisdiction.</p>

                  Every manufacturer has a vision to become a market leader. But in order to achieve those results, one has to create a facility that performs, grows and adds value to the company. ABMS laid out the plan for a facility focusing on improving execution performance. With focussed agenda and the elimination of waste approach, ABMS could achieve an improved delivery performance from 0 to 80%. Furthermore, manufacturing facilities involved in packaging machineries have to optimize their material flow to streamline their processes. ABMS implemented the Manufacturing Excellence Model to optimize the production capacity.</p>
               <b>Digitization and Data monitoring - Visual Management
              </b>
              <p>Digital transformation is the prerogative of every business, especially manufacturing. ABMS introduced data monitoring to track the process and integrate an efficient supply chain model. This in turn resulted into improved processes and easy procurements of materials. Not to forget that data monitoring saves a lot of time and labor.
                ABMS helped change the specific commodity approach to product line approach thereby reducing the lead time.</p>
              <b>Implementing Scheduling Systems, Advanced Storage and Dispatch System, Layout & Material Handling Systems, Asset Care</b>
              <p>Productive, efficient and fast dispatch means better storage and access. With the domain expertise, ABMS was able to introduce a successful MOQ for inventory. Assembly time was managed and improved for better performance and handling by identifying non-moving material, re location of spares stores and pre studying the assembly line.</p>
